This project is an Admin Dashboard application where an admin can manage users, assign roles, and handle user permissions. The system allows the admin to perform actions such as viewing, editing, deleting users, and assigning roles to users. Additionally, the admin can define and modify roles and permissions, providing fine-grained control over user access and actions within the application.
